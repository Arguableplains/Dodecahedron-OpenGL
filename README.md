# Dodecahedron-OpenGL
My first touch on OpenGL plus a small, but interesting, jouney through C++ language and Cmake builds

![](https://github.com/Arguableplains/Dodecahedron-OpenGL/blob/master/Dodecahedron.gif)

If you want to run it on your PC, be sure to have Cmake, make and the libraries (OpenGL, glfw and GLEW) installed

## Cmake Steps

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ./..
    make

And if you have any tip or suggestion to my code, feel free to contact me!
